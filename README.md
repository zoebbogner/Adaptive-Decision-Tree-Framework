# Adaptive Decision Tree Framework

## Overview
The **Adaptive Decision Tree Framework** is a Python-based implementation designed for efficient decision-making and classification. This framework leverages dynamic tree structures to optimize decision paths based on input data patterns. It is built to handle complex datasets with adaptability and precision, supporting various machine learning workflows.

---

## Features
- **Dynamic Decision Trees**:
  - Trees adapt based on input data to optimize decision paths.
- **Integration with External Data**:
  - Includes support for CSV-based datasets, such as `agaricus-lepiota.csv`.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook**:
  - Demonstrates the framework’s functionality with detailed examples.
- **Scalability**:
  - Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Version Control**:
  - Managed with Git for streamlined collaboration.
